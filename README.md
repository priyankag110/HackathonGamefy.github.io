<h3>Gamefy – An efficient way to shortlist Board Games</h3>

Gamefy is a web-based tool that will help users get a list of board games that would meet their input arguments. Given a dataset of about 5000 games ranging over a wide area of genres, number of minimum and maximum players, average time per game, it’s popularity, how many own the game, etc. This game dataset was used as a basis of our analyzing tool.

<h3>Business Need:</h3>
Based on the present-day lifestyle and the technological advancement, we need an application that will allow users to select among the best of the board games available based on their preferences.
<h3>Project Plan:</h3>
Per the given business need, we have developed a web-based application allowing its users to select the best of the board games available for fun and entertainment. A user would input a variety of input arguments as in the number of players, the expected complexity of the game, how many mechanics are involved in the game and Gamefy will use all this information to find out all the games belonging to these combined categories and generate a list of board games that are most suitable for the user (up to 20 results).
<h3>Analysis:</h3>
The results made available to the user, per the input criteria, are based on the analysis of the data made available, pertaining to the board games. The analysis has been done in depth, based on all the input criteria provided along with a cross-analysis among the same. These inputs from user are spread across a variety of factors. However, not all these are equally important across the board. Thus, we have incorporated several possible combinations of the data to be analyzed to provide the most accurate results. In addition, Gamefy will also generate a set of plots and figures that will help a user determine further the game they want to play. These plots are based on a detailed analysis the tool performs on the entire dataset and produces results depending on the input arguments of the users. The given dataset was also used to train a neural network and understand the diversity of the information available. This was performed by validation and testing of similar gaming data on our trained system to find out how accurately was the system trained and to eliminate any guesswork to find out what will be the most suitable game for a scenario.
